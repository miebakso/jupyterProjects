    "## Data Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Data models is a language for describing data org informations. The description consist of 3 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure of the data\n",
    "2. Operation on the data\n",
    "3. Constraints on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational data model is the most popular data model for managing structued data. The relational model is based on a structure to represent data, a-two demensional table called a relation. Basic of relational models:\n",
    "\n",
    "**attributes**: names for the column of a relation/table. each attribute has a **domain** (set of legal value that can be assgined to the attribute).\n",
    "\n",
    "**tuples**: are the rows of data in a relation comprising components that are atomic. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema of relation**: It's not the data itself, but a description of the data. It's writen by giving the name of the relation first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Movie(attr1,attr2)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relation instance** is a set of tuples/row data for a given relation. The 'relation\" can refer to a relation schema or a relation instance, can be determined form the context (refer to defintion which is schema or the content of the relation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie(mvID, Title, Rating, Re;_date, Length, Studio)\n",
    "\n",
    "the **domain** of the mvID in integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Integrity Constraint - Key and Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **primary key** and **key** are **data integrity constraint** to ensure meaningful data. A key can be an attribute or a set of attribute to distinguish one row/tuples from another. In the real world there can be the same movies with the same title, so using one attribute is not enough to distinguish 2 tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "if there are **several candidate keys**, one is specified as the **Primary Key**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Set of attributes can be used to distinguish any 2 tuples in the relation. The key movieID in Movie can be used to distinguised 2 movies. In that case it doesn't matter if 2 movies have the same title, they must have 2 different movieID. Although moiveID is artifical, not like title or other attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes using one atrifical attribute is better than using multiples attributes to be the key. Yes, we can use title+date+director as keys to distinguish one movie from another, but it's too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "**There are situation Where 1 key is not enough**\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance the movie \"Angles and Demon\" have 2 genre which is action and drama. In this case because of the relation, we need to have 2 row which consist of row with the genre action and another with the genre drama. So to distinguish 2 rows with another, movieID is not enough. Genre itself is not enough because there can be another movie with the same genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you combine (movieID, Genre) it is enough to distinguish one tuples/row from another. It's called **composite key**, it is a candidate key that consists of two or more attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key and Primary key\n",
    "\n",
    "Key constraint is a natural property of the real-wold that is define in the schema level. \n",
    "\n",
    "why do we need to specify one as the primary key when we have many possible key in a relation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need to link multiple relations. We need to specify one primary key to link one relation to another. So foreigh key is a contraint that decalre that an attribute or attributes of a relation refrence the primary key or key of a second relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "primary key is indicated by ______ underline  \n",
    "Foreign key is indicate by (*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The foreign key prevents introducing nonsensical data into the relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: no insertion or update of the child relation introduces values not found in the parent. It's like giving a job to a non existing department. It doesn't make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie(<u>movieID</u>, Title, Rating, Rel_Date, Length, Studio)  \n",
    "Classification(<u>movieID*, genre</u>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie is the parent and the classification is the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is only 5 movieID in movie, we are not allow to insert a movieID 6 to Classification because it doesn't exist in movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we define the schema for realtion, the attributes, the domain, primary key constraints and foreign key constraints. All the relation instances they because a the relational database instance. A relation databse compromise a set of tables/relations.  \n",
