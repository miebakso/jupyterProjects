    "Data are generated every seconds from different sources such as phone, satelite, sensors, web, RMIT, etc. With the huge amount the data, there comes the need to manage the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Database management system (DBMS) is a software that manage data effectively and efficiently. Effectively means that the data store doesn't take too much space. Efficiently mean fast result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database System Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Databases \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Database programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Transaction and concurrency control\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1st Dimension: Databese Users\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Administrator**: full control of the database, grant privileges to other user, create and define database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Developer**: manage/control their own database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **End users/dataoperators**: only retrieve or update information in some part of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2nd Dimension: Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Database is a collection of data manage by DBMS. DBMS manage data by defining **schema** (it's definition for the data) and **data files** (contains data).\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is manage under DBMS, it needs to be a Schema. A schema is define using a data model. The relations model is the most common model. The schema can be describe using Entitiy Relationship (ER) model. Schema has data constraints to make sure data integrity. Constraint ensure the data keep is meaningfull.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is that schema & data model?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, schema define/describe the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A schema is a blueprint of the database which specifies what fields will be present and what would be their types.  For example an employee table will have an employee_ID column represented by a string of 10 digits and an employee_Name column with a string of 45 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data model is a language for describing data or information which generally consit of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. structure of the data\n",
    "2. Operations on the class\n",
    "3. Constraints on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model is a high level design which decides what can be present in the schema. It provides a database user with a conceptual framework in which we specify the database requirements of the database user and the structure of the database to fulfill these requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data model can, for example, be a relational model where the data will be organised in tables whereas the schema for this model would be the set of attributes and their corresponding domains.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Popular Data Model\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. The relational model for structure data, include object-relational extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The semi-structure data model, inlcuding XML and related standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference Between Schema and Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that a **data model describes requirements** for data definitions of descriptive information and relationships, while a database, either with a schema or schemaless, is the code that implements storage on a specific database platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "So more simply the **data model is the definition**, the **database schema is the implementation**. The data model is the design for the data irrespective of storage technology; the database schema is the design for the data modified to fit in a specific database technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3rd Dimensions Database Programming Langguage\n",
    "\n",
    "data are files on the hard disk on computers. The files are manage by a DBMS who is on top some file system. (ex: windows file system)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the file we need a programming laguage **Structured Query Language** (SQL). With SQL, we can read, retrieve, and update the data. SQL can also be used to chagne **meta data**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Meta Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta data/data dictionary is data describing the database which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Schema definition\n",
    "2. Index (index speed up query processing)\n",
    "3. Data types\n",
    "4. COnstraints on data\n",
    "5. User informations and privileges\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured Query Language (SQL) \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a bit misleading because SQL not only a query language but, SQL is also as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Definition Language (DDL): Define schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Query Language (DQL): Query the database to extract informations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Manipulation Language (DML): Update the database - insert/delete/update\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is declarative query language, it is short programs, and system optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT count(student) FROM Student (declarative, short, optimize)\n",
    "\n",
    "In python:\n",
    "import the file\n",
    "loop through the file\n",
    "count each student\n",
    "return the result\n",
    "\n",
    "long, tell the program how to solve so it's not declarative, not optimize."

    "## Transactions and Concurrency Control\n",
    "\n",
    "DBMS has many user that operate on the database concurrenly. Transcations in an atomic unit consist of one or more operations. All of the operations on the transaction must be completed or nothing happens at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution of transactions should be durable, even there is system failure. We wanted to ensure that all the transactions is executed. To achive this we need **loggin**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACID Properties of Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Atomicity - All or nothing executions of transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consistency - A transactions bring database from one state to another. EX bank balance can't be negative\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Isolation - Each transactions must appear to execute as if no other transactions are occuring\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Durability - Effect of a transaction must neber be lost once a transaction completed\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"transaction.png\"></img>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The DBMS has 3 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stroage Managements**: Managing and store data effetively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Processing**: How efficienly execute queries (SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transactions Management**: Support and achive ACID properties."
